When using a "takeover" image gallery, a site's logo and navigation may fall on an area of the underlying image that makes it difficult to see.

This script will invert your site's logo and navigation when the designated images are shown.

```html
<script>
	// Image IDs
	invertColors = [
		"6290098f3fccbed8f5376ac1",
		"6290098d3fccbed8f5376aaf",
	]
</script>
```

Replace the codes in the list with the value of the `data-id` attribute for each image you'd like to prompt and inversion.

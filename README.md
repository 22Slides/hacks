# 22Slides Hacks

This is a collection of custom CSS and Javascript code snippets and hacks for 22Slides websites. They're to help people get the desired look/functionality out of their website when what they're looking for is outside the scope of the normal options.

Using custom code requires knowledge of CSS and Javascript and is considered an advanced technique. Please note that custom codes are not future-proof, and they may stop working after updates are made to 22Slides.

These codes can be very useful for those that know what they're doing, but Resen/22Slides *does not* offer support should you run into problems. Use at your own risk.
